                <title>Anatomy of Analytics</title>
                
                
                    <description>&lt;p&gt;Years ago, when I made the switch from procedural to object oriented
programming, concepts such as function overloading fascinated me.  A
single function changing and behaving based on the types of values
passed to it spoke volumes to its simplicity and elegance. Feeling a
bit nostalgic I am going to say, &amp;quot;Those were the good old days!&amp;quot;
Today, the word &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Analytics&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; is certainly an overloaded term in the
data world!  It is used to define work done by data scientists to
business analysts and from execution of sophisticated statistical
algorithms to the use of simple visualization tools. Oh, and let&amp;#39;s not
forget its synonymous use with the term &amp;quot;Big Data.&amp;quot; I wish I could
muster up the same sense of euphoria for the overloaded term
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Analytics&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; that I once felt for the use of overloaded functions
in a class definition.&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>Building a simple Spray application - Part 2</title>
                
                
                    <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://engineering.monsanto.com/2015/08/11/simple-spray/&quot;&gt;Last time we spoke&lt;/a&gt;
we went through the simple building blocks to creating a Spray
application.  As you go forward though, you will want to have more
options in composing your routes, and making sure the routes are
constructed correctly.&lt;/p&gt;

                    <description>&lt;p&gt;Monsanto sent several of our IT staff to &lt;a href=&quot;https://reinvent.awsevents.com/&quot; title=&quot;AWS re:Invent 2015&quot;&gt;AWS re:Invent&lt;/a&gt;
last week. We learned a lot and were excited to hear about the new
services announced, especially those around the EC2 Container Service,
Kinesis, IoT, AWS Config, and the data import/export device Snowball.
We also gave a few talks and look forward to connecting and
collaborating with the many that came up after the talks and spoke to
us. If you couldn&amp;#39;t attend in person, have a look and
&lt;a href=&quot;http://engineering.monsanto.com/contact/&quot; title=&quot;Contact Monsanto Engineering&quot;&gt;let us know what you think&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>Cloud Different</title>
                
                
                    <description>&lt;p&gt;Over the past several years, cloud computing of all types has gained a
lot of momentum. Because of the massive increase in mobile computing,
i.e., phones and tablets, more and more people are consuming cloud
services like GMail, DropBox, Instagram, and Office365. These Software
as a Service (SaaS) solutions are convenient for people on the go
because the information they need is always easily accessible through
a web browser or mobile app. This is possible because the user&amp;#39;s data
and preferences are stored &amp;quot;in the cloud&amp;quot;, using servers and services
managed by someone else, typically the operator of the SaaS
solution. While these SaaS solutions are convenient for end users,
they do not allow for much customization. To develop custom
capabilities in the cloud, you must turn to Infrastructure as a
Service (IaaS).&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>Better Spray metrics with Kamon</title>
                
                
                    <description>&lt;p&gt;At Monsanto, we have adopted &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kamon.io&quot; title=&quot;The Open Source tool for monitoring applications running on the JVM&quot;&gt;Kamon&lt;/a&gt; for monitoring our microservices
implemented in Scala with &lt;a href=&quot;http://spray.io/&quot; title=&quot;Elegant, high-performance HTTP for your Akka Actors&quot;&gt;Spray&lt;/a&gt;.  Kamon provides an
&lt;a href=&quot;http://kamon.io/integrations/web-and-http-toolkits/spray/&quot; title=&quot;Kamon Spray integration&quot;&gt;integration&lt;/a&gt; that will automatically instrument our services to
generate traces for each incoming request.  This is great, but we wanted more.
Some of the things we wanted to improve included:&lt;/p&gt;

much of it is concerned with two major questions:&lt;/p&gt;
