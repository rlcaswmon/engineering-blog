#Cloud Foundry User administration

In the third installation of our open source [Cloud Foundry (CF) toolbox series](http://engineering.monsanto.com/2015/07/22/building-an-open-source-cloud-foundry-toolbox/), we unveil [CF-Users](https://github.com/MonsantoCo/cf-users), this offers a web based solution for managing Cloud Foundry user credentials and authorizations.   This web application offers easy to use web pages for simultaneously adding users and configuring a users permissions, as well as giving two different workflows for modifying a users roles within Cloud Foundry.  In a large organization, relying on the command line interface to add users and configure multiple roles to individuals had become a cumbersome time consuming task that was taking more and more time as we became more reliant on Cloud Foundry.  This application offers an easy to use web interface that greatly improves efficiency by reducing the effort needed to complete such tasks to a few mouse clicks and simple form entry to add new users.

## Deploying the application
To deploy this application you will need to  create a UAA client user with the necessary privileges to add users and modify privileges.  Once this is done you will need to create a users provided service for CF-Users to utilize for connectivity to cloud foundry.  You will need to gather data for the following fields in this service:
<ul>
<li>Domain name for cloud foundry api rest services</li>
<li>Domain name for UAA rest services</li>
<li>Domain name for login url for authentication</li>
<li>ID of client users that you just created</li>
<li>Secret of client that you just created</li>
<li>Administrator user ID</li>
<li>Administrator user password</li>
<li>Email domain of active directory users for example who@cloudfoundry.com would have an email domain of cloudfoundry.com</li>
<li>Optionally, a SAML provider name</li>
</ul>

Once the user provided service is created you will need to push the app with the --no-start option.  Bind the user provided service created above, map the route, and start the application.

## Using the application

### Add User
Organization managers and space managers both may add users to with CF-Users.  However, organization managers may only assign roles within organizations that that they manager.  Likewise, space managers may only assign roles within spaces that they manage.  Just enter the username and optionally password depending on the type of user account created, select roles for the user, and click the Create User button.

### Edit User
This screen allows organization managers and space managers to modify the privileges assigned to users.  The user roles may be selected or deselected by clicking the appropriate checkboxes.   The privileges are updated as these checkboxes are clicked and feedback is given with a growl message when the action is completed.

### User Role Admin
This screen allows privilege modification from the perspective of the organization and spaces rather than from the user perspective.  This is accomplished by allowing the selection of the organization and/or space and displaying a list of users who have can be assigned roles at the chosen level.  As with edit users, The privileges are updated as the checkboxes are clicked and feedback is given with a growl message when the action is completed.
