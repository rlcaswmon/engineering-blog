				<p>Years ago, when I made the switch from procedural to object oriented
programming, concepts such as function overloading fascinated me.  A
single function changing and behaving based on the types of values
passed to it spoke volumes to its simplicity and elegance. Feeling a
bit nostalgic I am going to say, &quot;Those were the good old days!&quot;
Today, the word <strong><em>Analytics</em></strong> is certainly an overloaded term in the
data world!  It is used to define work done by data scientists to
business analysts and from execution of sophisticated statistical
algorithms to the use of simple visualization tools. Oh, and let&#39;s not
forget its synonymous use with the term &quot;Big Data.&quot; I wish I could
muster up the same sense of euphoria for the overloaded term
<strong><em>Analytics</em></strong> that I once felt for the use of overloaded functions
in a class definition.</p>

<p>In this multi-part series of posts I will share practical knowledge
about using data to gain insights that I have acquired during my
career as a data and information architect. In addition, I will
highlight the discipline that is required to create the supporting
architecture and challenges encountered along the way when
instantiating a comprehensive analytical platform. The first step on
this journey is simply defining the consumers of information and
understanding what they need. In short, the first commandment is
simply: know thy information consumer. Figure 1 captures the essence
of this concept by defining four distinct types of consumers of data
&mdash; information consumer, information pro-consumer, data
scientist, and machine.</p>

<p><img src="/img/Information_Consumers.png" alt="Information Consumer Types">
<center> Figure 1 - Information Consumer Types </center></p>

<p>One thing to note in Figure 1 is that the word <strong><em>Analytics</em></strong> is
sparingly used. This was deliberate. All information presented has
analytical value. More on that in the next post. For now, let&#39;s just
say before the word <strong><em>Analytics</em></strong> took on a life of its own, many of
the terms above sufficed to describe how different consumers analyzed
data and information.  It was not long ago that the terms such as
&quot;slicing and dicing&quot; and &quot;drill down analysis&quot; were commonly used to
describe capabilities which allowed users to make important
decisions. Today those capabilities are still an integral component of
Business Intelligence and offered by many vendors as a standard
offerings in their respective suite of products.</p>

<p>A few observations on information consumers in each category:</p>

<p><strong><em>Information Consumers</em></strong> are generally the business users and
executives that want access to timely and accurate reports and
dashboards through intuitive and user friendly interfaces. The
information consumed by this group of consumers needs to be highly
accurate, trusted, and reproducible.  Additional characteristics of
information consumed by this set of users could be simple aggregated
views of past sales or financial data for a specific region or a view
of forecasted sales numbers generated through some sophisticated
prediction algorithm.</p>

<p><strong><em>Information Pro-Consumers</em></strong> are commonly known by more familiar
terms such as business analysts and power users. This group is
concerned with performing analysis on data and generally their focus
is to understand the past in order to predict the future. In addition
to accuracy and timeliness this group often demands low latency and
high accessibility to data. More over, this group prefers to have
multiple tools at their disposal to be able to perform aggregations,
calculations, slicing, and dicing as well as ad hoc analysis on data.</p>

<p><strong><em>Data Scientists</em></strong> do not need any introduction. Lately, much has
been said and written about this set of users. A quick search on the
web will prove that. But this series is not about defining who they
are. Instead it is about what they would like to do with
data. Regardless of whether these users are statisticians with
computer science degrees or computational experts in some specific
field, their needs revolve around having access to any and every piece
of data &mdash; big or small, structured or unstructured.  Often the
discovery process and experimentation undertaken by this group may
include diverse techniques ranging from simple data mining to applying
various statistical algorithms to testing some hypothesis.  In the
end, applying sophisticated statistical techniques and/or machine
learning algorithms to create insights is the primary motivation
behind the work of this user community. A few posts from one of my
colleagues are an interesting read on this particular data consumer
type: <a href="http://engineering.monsanto.com/2015/11/09/what-makes-a-data-scientist-part-1/">What makes a data scientist – Part 1</a> &amp;
<a href="http://engineering.monsanto.com/2015/11/11/what-makes-a-data-scientist-part-2/">What makes a data scientist – Part 2</a>.</p>

<p><strong><em>Machines</em></strong> operate on data and need data to operate. Despite this
fact, in the data world the needs of this voiceless group is often
overlooked.  With increased mechanization and automation,
system-to-system communication is only increasing in importance and
scale. Whether it is data collected through sensors and passed on to
other systems for processing or data made available via APIs for
general consumption by external users or partners, the fact remains
that most companies are still trying to shore up their ability to
service this important category of consumers.</p>

<p>In conclusion, the message is simple. It is critical to understand the
needs of those you serve. Such a basic yet crucial piece of
information should be a precursor to everything else that
follows. Whether it is creating a reference architecture or standing
up a scalable analytical platform, one thing is immediately apparent
from Figure 1: the platform will need to cover use cases ranging from
machine learning to ad hoc analysis, data analysis to sophisticated
analytics, and from simple information consumption through APIs to
machine-to-machine communication. A key mandate for a successful
analytical platform is to make sure that the need of each consumer
type is addressed holistically in helping them turn data into useful
information and insights.</p>
